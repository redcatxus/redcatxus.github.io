<p>Welcome.</p>
<p>Either you found this place from my nonexistent social media accounts, or you are just a clumsy guy that &quot;accidentally&quot; went in.</p>
<p>What&apos;s that? you&apos;d like to speak with me? well, if you insisted, here you go.</p>
<p>I can be found on <a href="https://discordapp.com/users/860118600266547221">Discord</a> where I&apos;ll be active most of the time.</p>
<p>Here&apos;s another one, my <a href="https://x.com/redcatxus">X (Formerly known as Twitter)</a> account, rarely used.</p>
<p>Aaaand... my <a href="https://instagram.com/redcatxus">Instagram</a> account, rarely in use as well... just visit my discord account.</p>
