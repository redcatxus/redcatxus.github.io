<p>Welcome to The Void.</p>
<p>Either you found this place from my nonexistent social media accounts, or you *** just a clumsy guy that &quot;accidentally&quot; went in.</p>
<p>What&apos;s that? you&apos;d like to speak with me? well, if you insisted, here you go.</p>
<p>I can be found on <a href="https://discordapp.com/users/860118600266547221">Discord</a> where I&apos;ll be active most of the time.</p>
<p>Here&apos;s another one, my <a href="http://httpw://x.com/redcatxus">X (Formerly known as Twitter)</a> account, where I may just occasionally post stuff there if I am in the mood to do so.</p>
<p>Aaaand... my <a href="https://instagram.com/redcatxus">Instagram</a> account, where I may post stuff for school projects.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>No, I don&apos;t have a TikTok or Facebook account. If anyone is posing as me anywhere online, you can directly slip into my <a href="https://discordapp.com/users/860118600266547221">Discord</a> profile and confirm its legitimacy.</p>
